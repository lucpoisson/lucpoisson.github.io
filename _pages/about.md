Hi! I am a final-year PhD student at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) advised by [Florent Krzakala](https://florentkrzakala.com]) working at the intersection of machine learning, statistical physics, and high-dimensional statistics. 

My research explores how structural properties of high-dimensional data help general-purpose training methods overcome the curse of dimensionality and learn efficiently.

Previously, I interned at [Aqemia](https://www.aqemia.com/), where I worked at the interface of physics-based approaches and generative AI ones for structure-based drug discovery. Before starting my PhD, I was part of the [International Msc](http://www.pcs.polito.it/presentation) in Theoretical Physics organized by: [ICTP](https://www.ictp.it), [Paris Cité U.](https://u-paris.fr/en/), [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/en), [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it), [Sorbonne U.](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en), and [U. Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en).

If you want to know more about my research, the list of my publications is [here](/publications).
