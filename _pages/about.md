Hi! I am a final-year PhD student at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) advised by [Florent Krzakala](https://florentkrzakala.com]) working at the intersection of machine learning, statistical physics, and high-dimensional statistics. 

My research revolves around understanding the role that <u>data structure</u> plays in the success of modern learning algorithms. Indeed, the presence of <u>low-dimensional relevant subspaces</u> in high-dimensional data is a crucial ingredient for explaining the performance of learning routines that would otherwise face severe limitations due to the curse of dimensionality.
To this end, statistical physics provides a powerful framework to study this problem by formalizing the notion of <u>phase transitions</u>.

Previously, I worked as a Research Intern at [Aqemia](https://www.aqemia.com/), where I focused on the interface of physics-based approaches (Molecular Density Functional Theory) and generative AI ones for structure-based drug discovery. Before starting my PhD, I was part of the [International Msc](http://www.pcs.polito.it/presentation) in Theoretical Physics organized by a consortium of universities: [ICTP](https://www.ictp.it), [Paris Cité U.](https://u-paris.fr/en/), [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/en), [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it), [Sorbonne U.](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en), and [U. Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en).

If you want to know more about my research, the list of my publications is [here](/publications).
