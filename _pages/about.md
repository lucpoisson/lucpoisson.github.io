Hi! I am a final-year PhD student at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) advised by [Prof. Florent Krzakala](https://florentkrzakala.com]) working at the intersection of machine learning, statistical physics, and high-dimensional statistics. I am particularly interested in understanding the role that <u> data structure</u> plays in the success of learning algorithms.

My research revolves around building a theoretical understanding of the <u>statistical and computational limits</u> of learning algorithms (such as Stochatstic Gradient Descent or Bayesian methods) in the high-dimensional regime, where the number of datapoints and their dimension are growing to infinity together. 
In particular, I analyze how the presence of <u>low-dimensional structures</u> in the data can guide efficient learning in high dimensions.
To this end, statistical physics provides a powerful framework to study the performance of algorithms formalizing the notions of <u>phase transitions</u> (learning/not learning) and <u>emergent phenomena</u>.

If you want to know more about my research, the list of my publications is [here](/publications).
