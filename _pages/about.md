Hi! I am a final-year PhD student at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) advised by [Florent Krzakala](https://florentkrzakala.com]) working at the intersection of machine learning, statistical physics, and high-dimensional statistics. I am particularly interested in understanding the role that <u> data structure</u> plays in the success of learning algorithms.

My research revolves around building a theoretical understanding of the <u>statistical and computational limits</u> of learning algorithms (such as Stochatstic Gradient Descent or Bayesian methods) in the high-dimensional regime, where the number of datapoints and their dimension are growing to infinity together. 
In particular, I analyze how the presence of <u>low-dimensional structures</u> in the data can guide efficient learning in high dimensions.
To this end, statistical physics provides a powerful framework to study the performance of learning routines by formalizing the notion of <u>phase transitions</u> (learning versus not learning) and identifying low-dimensional <u>order parameters</u> (sufficient statistics) that govern the learning process.

Before starting my PhD, I was part of the [International Master's degree](http://www.pcs.polito.it/presentation) in Theoretical Physics organized by a consortium of universities [ICTP](https://www.ictp.it), [Paris Cité U.](https://u-paris.fr/en/), [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/en), [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it), [Sorbonne U.](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en), [U. Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en).

If you want to know more about my research, the list of my publications is [here](/publications).
