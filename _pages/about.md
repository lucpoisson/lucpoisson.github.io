Hi! I am a final-year PhD student at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) advised by [Florent Krzakala](https://florentkrzakala.com]) working at the intersection of machine learning, statistical physics, and high-dimensional statistics. 

I am interested in understanding <u> why </u> modern deep learning systems are so effective in practice. To this end, my research focuses on the role of <u> low-dimensional latent structures </u> within high-dimensional data in enabling efficient learning. Using statistical physics techniques, I study how general-purpose training methods (e.g., SGD) exploit such structures to overcome the curse of dimensionality.

Previously, I worked as a research intern at [Aqemia](https://www.aqemia.com/) and I took part in an [International Msc](http://www.pcs.polito.it/educational_tracks/international_track) program in Theoretical Physics organized by: [ICTP](https://www.ictp.it), [Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/en/), [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/en), [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it), [Sorbonne](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en), and [Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en).

If you want to know more about my research, the list of my publications is [here](/publications).
