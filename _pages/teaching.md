I have been teaching assistant for Machine Learning and Physics courses at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/).

- EE-411: "Fundamental of Inference and Learning" - [Link](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/fundamentals-of-inference-and-learning-EE-411) (Fall 2021 - 2024)
    First year MSc course in Electrical Engineering covering the basics of statistical inference and learning. The course material is available on the [Github repository](https://github.com/IdePHICS/FundamentalLearningEPFL) ranging from Maximum Likelihood Estimation to methods in modern deep learning.

- EE-209: "Eléments de statistiques pour les data sciences" -  [Link](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/elements-of-statistics-for-data-science-EE-209) (Spring 2024)
    Second year BSc course in Electrical Engineering taught in French on the basics of probability and statistics.

- PHYS-642: "Statistical Physics for Optimization & Learning" -  [Link](https://idephics.github.io/EPFLDoctoralLecture2023/) (Spring 2023)
    Doctoral lecture on the connection between statistical physics and optimization and learning. The course material is available on the [Github repository](https://github.com/IdePHICS/EPFLDoctoralLecture2023).

- PHYS-314: "Physique Quantique II" - [Link](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/quantum-physics-ii-PHYS-314) 
    Third year BSc course in Physics taught in French focused on many-body quantum systems and group theory for physicists.
