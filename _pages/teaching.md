I have been teaching assistant for Machine Learning and Physics courses at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/).

###  EE-411: "Fundamental of Inference and Learning" 
##### (Fall 2021 - 2024) - [Link to course webpage](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/fundamentals-of-inference-and-learning-EE-411) 
    
First year MSc course in Electrical Engineering covering the basics of statistical inference and learning. The course material is available on the [Github repository](https://github.com/IdePHICS/FundamentalLearningEPFL) and covers different topics ranging from Maximum Likelihood Estimation to modern deep learning techniques.
### EE-209: "Eléments de statistiques pour les data sciences"    
##### (Spring 2024) - [Link to course webpage](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/elements-of-statistics-for-data-science-EE-209)
 
Second year BSc course in Electrical Engineering taught in French on the basics of probability and statistics. 

### PHYS-642: "Statistical Physics for Optimization & Learning" 
##### (Spring 2023) - -  [Link to course webpage](https://idephics.github.io/EPFLDoctoralLecture2023/) 

Doctoral course in the Physics and Engineering school on the connection between statistical physics and learning. The course material is available on the [Github repository](https://github.com/IdePHICS/EPFLDoctoralLecture2023) and covers a broad range of topics in statistical physics of disordered systems ranging from the fundamental tools (replica and cavity method) to their application in learning problems (inference on graph, neural networks).

### PHYS-314: "Physique Quantique II" 
##### Spring 2022 - [Link to course webpage](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/quantum-physics-ii-PHYS-314) 

Third year BSc course in Physics taught in French focused on many-body quantum systems and group theory for physicists.
